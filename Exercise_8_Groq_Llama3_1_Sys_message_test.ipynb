            "1. **Prepare the sambar masala powder:** Dry roast the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and fennel seeds in a pan until fragrant. Let them cool, then grind them into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle. Mix in the cinnamon powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and garam masala powder. Store the sambar masala powder in an airtight container.\n",
            "2. **Cook the lentils:** Rinse the split red lentils and split yellow lentils together and soak them in water for at least 30 minutes. Drain the water and cook the lentils in a pressure cooker or a large pot with 4 cups of water until they are mushy and well-cooked.\n",
            "3. **Prepare the vegetables:** Heat oil in a pan and saut√© the chopped onions, minced garlic, diced tomato, carrot, potato, and drumsticks until they are tender and lightly browned.\n",
            "4. **Make the sambar:** Add the cooked lentils, tamarind paste, sambar masala powder, and salt to the pan with the vegetables. Mix well and add water as needed to achieve a thick, but pourable consistency.\n",
            "5. **Simmer the sambar:** Bring the sambar to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until the flavors have melded together and the sambar has thickened slightly.\n",
            "6. **Serve:** Garnish the sambar with fresh cilantro and serve with steaming hot rice, idlis, dosas, or vadas.\n",

            "**Tips and Variations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* You can customize the vegetables in the sambar according to your preference.\n",
            "* Adjust the amount of tamarind paste and sambar masala powder to suit your taste.\n",
            "* For a thicker sambar, reduce the amount of water or add more lentils.\n",
            "* You can also add other spices like cumin seeds, mustard seeds, or curry leaves to the sambar for added flavor.\n",
            "* Sambar can be made ahead of time and refrigerated or frozen for later use. Reheat it before serving.\n",
